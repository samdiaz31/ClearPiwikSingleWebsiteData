Recently I started using Piwik at my new job. According to their website, it's "a free web analytics tool that provides you with detailed reports on your website's visitors, your marketing campaigns and much more. Piwik is an open source alternative to Google Analytics, available in 45 languages, and has been downloaded more than 1 million times!" One thing I noticed it was missing was an easy way to clear out analytics after you've been testing before going live with a website. After a bit of researching, I found http://piwik.org/faq/how-to/#faq_73 which gave me an idea; why not write a simple query with a variable to do all of these things at once, but for a single website instead of dropping ALL of the data in the DB.
